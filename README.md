<h1>Show the local Weather</h1>
<p>My 2nd Intermediate Front End Development Project for FreeCodeCamp.</p>

User Story:
- I can see the weather in my current location.
- I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
